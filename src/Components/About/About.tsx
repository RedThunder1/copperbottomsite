                When it comes to technology and ethics, there is a catchup that needs to desperately happen.
                Workerâ€™s rights are falling further and further behind and our company can build a better future by investing in those
                laborers that are the foundation of our workforce and ensure that every voice is properly heard.</div>

                <p>We aim to provide resources to support workers in the industry such as,</p>
                <p>    - Support and resources for workers to unionize.</p>
                <p>    - Tipping directly to worker who will receive the full amount.</p>
                <p>    - Support for delivery drivers with reviews of customers and other resources.</p>
